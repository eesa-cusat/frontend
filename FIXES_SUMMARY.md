# EESA Frontend Admin Panel Fixes

## Issues Identified and Resolved:

### 1. **API URL Pattern Inconsistencies**
**Problem:** The frontend was using inconsistent API URL patterns, mixing `/api/` and `/accounts/` prefixes.

**Solution:** Updated all API calls to use the correct URL pattern:
- Authentication endpoints: `/api/accounts/auth/csrf/` and `/api/accounts/auth/me/`
- Other endpoints: `/api/events/events/`, `/api/academics/schemes/`, etc.

### 2. **Authentication Context Issues**
**Problem:** The auth context was using JWT-based authentication but the backend expected session-based auth.

**Solution:** 
- Refactored `AuthContext` to use session-based authentication
- Updated to use the `authService` from `services/auth.ts`
- Added proper group-based access control with `hasGroupAccess()` and `canAccessAdmin()` methods

### 3. **Data Fetching Failures**
**Problem:** Admin panels were not loading data because:
- Incorrect API endpoints
- Missing CSRF tokens for POST/PUT/DELETE requests
- No error handling for failed requests

**Solution:**
- Updated all admin panel pages to fetch data on mount
- Added proper CSRF token handling for all mutations
- Added comprehensive error handling and user feedback

### 4. **CRUD Operations Not Working**
**Problem:** Create, Update, Delete operations were not working due to:
- Missing CSRF tokens
- Incorrect API endpoints
- No proper data refresh after operations

**Solution:**
- Added CSRF token fetching before all mutation operations
- Fixed API endpoint URLs
- Added data refresh functionality after successful operations

### 5. **Admin Access Control**
**Problem:** The admin panels weren't properly checking user permissions.

**Solution:**
- Implemented proper group-based access control
- Added loading states and error handling for unauthorized access
- Updated user interface to show only accessible panels

## Files Modified:

1. **`src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`** - Completely refactored for session-based auth
2. **`src/services/auth.ts`** - Updated API endpoints with `/api/` prefix
3. **`src/app/eesa/page.tsx`** - Fixed admin dashboard data loading
4. **`src/app/eesa/academics/page.tsx`** - Fixed academics panel data loading and CRUD operations
5. **`src/app/eesa/events/page.tsx`** - Fixed events panel data loading and creation
6. **`src/app/eesa/people/page.tsx`** - Fixed people panel data loading and creation
7. **`src/services/adminAPI.ts`** - Created comprehensive API service for admin operations
8. **`src/app/eesa/test/page.tsx`** - Created diagnostic tool to test API endpoints

## Key Changes Made:

### API Endpoint Updates:
```javascript
// OLD (incorrect)
'/accounts/auth/csrf/' 
'/accounts/auth/me/'

// NEW (correct)
'/api/accounts/auth/csrf/'
'/api/accounts/auth/me/'
```

### Authentication Flow:
```javascript
// Session-based authentication with CSRF tokens
const { csrfToken } = await fetch('/api/accounts/auth/csrf/');
const response = await fetch('/api/endpoint/', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'X-CSRFToken': csrfToken,
  },
  credentials: 'include',
  body: JSON.stringify(data),
});
```

### Data Loading Pattern:
```javascript
const loadData = async () => {
  try {
    setIsLoading(true);
    const response = await fetch(`${API_BASE_URL}/endpoint/`, {
      credentials: 'include',
      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    });
    
    if (response.ok) {
      const data = await response.json();
      setData(data.results || data);
    } else {
      toast.error('Failed to load data');
    }
  } catch (error) {
    toast.error('Network error');
  } finally {
    setIsLoading(false);
  }
};
```

## Testing:

Use the test page at `/eesa/test` to verify that all API endpoints are working correctly. This will help identify any remaining connection issues with the backend.

## Next Steps:

1. **Backend Verification:** Ensure your Django backend has the correct endpoints at the expected URLs
2. **CSRF Configuration:** Verify Django CSRF settings allow requests from your frontend domain
3. **CORS Setup:** Ensure proper CORS configuration for cross-origin requests
4. **Database Data:** Make sure your backend has some test data to display in the admin panels

## Expected Behavior After Fixes:

1. ✅ Admin panel login should work with session authentication
2. ✅ Dashboard should display statistics from the backend
3. ✅ Events panel should load and allow creating new events
4. ✅ Academics panel should load schemes, subjects, and resources
5. ✅ People panel should load team members and allow adding new ones
6. ✅ All CRUD operations should work and update the database
7. ✅ Proper error messages should appear for failed operations
